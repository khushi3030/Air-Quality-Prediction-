Air-Quality-Prediction

Objective-

The goal of this project is to predict Air Quality Index (AQI ) form features as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitric Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3) etc.

CONCLUSION

By using Linear Regression model
Accuracy achieved :  78.81
 
By using Lasso Regression model
Accuracy achieved :  78.81

By using Ridge Regression model
Accuracy achieved :  78.81

By using Decision Tree Regressor model
Accuracy achieved :  99.91


Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, lasso regression and rigde regression is almost same.

Whereas accuracy of decision tree regressor is higher and root mean sqaure error is least.

Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
